----------------------------------------------------------------------

    1.	What is the Network Audio System?

>>	In a nutshell, NAS is the audio equivalent of an X display
	server. 

	The Network Audio System was developed by NCD for playing,
	recording, and manipulating audio data over a network.
	Like the X Window System, it uses the client/server model to
	separate applications from the specific drivers that control
	audio input and output devices.

	Key features of the Network Audio System include:

	    o   Device-independent audio over the network
	    o   Lots of audio file and data formats
	    o   Can store sounds in server for rapid replay
	    o   Extensive mixing, separating, and manipulation of audio data
	    o   Simultaneous use of audio devices by multiple applications
	    o   Use by a growing number of ISVs
	    o   Small size
	    o   Free!  No obnoxious licensing terms


    2.	Where can I get it?

>>	The latest release of the Network Audio System can be obtained
	from:

		http://radscan.com/nas.html
		ftp.x.org:/contrib/audio/nas

		As many other ftp archives I can stick it on.

    3.	What platforms does NAS run on?

>>	The Network Audio System distribution includes sample server
	implementations for:

	    o Sun Sparc 1 AM79C30A Digital Subscriber Controller and
		  Sparc 10 Dual Basic Rate ISDN Interface
	      (SunOS 4.1.[23], Solaris 2.x)

	    o SGI Indigo (IRIX 5.x)

	    o VOXware (FreeBSD, NetBSDm Linux, SVR4.[02], Unixware)

	    o HPUX 10.10+
	 
	Version 1.4 has been built on:

        - Linux/glibc 2.1, 2.2.14 kernel (Mandrake 7)
        - Unixware (X11R5 and native compiler)
        - Unixware (X11R6.4 and gcc 2.95.2 compiler)
        - HPUX 10.10 using X11R6.1 and gcc 2.95.2
        - Sparc Solaris 2.6 using native compiler and X environment

	Also, several models of NCD X terminals as well as NCD's
	PCXware (an X server for PCs running Microsoft Windows) all
	include an NAS server.

	Ports of the NAS server to additional platforms are in the
	works.

	The NAS sample clients will compile and run on numerous
	platforms.


    4.	Is there a mailing list?

>>	You bet.  nas@radscan.com is a mailing list for general discussion
	of the Network Audio System.  Send a message to
	nas@radscan.com with a line in the body containing 
	'subscribe nas <your email address>.

	The archives for this list are maintained by Grant Taylor, and
	can be found at:

		http://www.picante.com/~gtaylor/archives/nas/ or
		http://gatekeeper.picante.com/~gtaylor/archives/nas/

    5.  I'm having problems getting the NAS clients to work with my
	NCD X terminal.

>>	Some NCD X terminal models running NCDware 3.0.1 or greater
	support NCDaudio, NCD's X terminal implementation of the
	Network Audio System.  Audio clients shipped with a particular
	NCDware release should function correctly with that release.
	However, the NAS protocol changed slightly after the release
	of NCDware 3.0.1, making newer clients incompatible with older
	servers.  NAS clients should function correctly with NCDware
	3.1 or greater.  Please contact support@ncd.com if you have
	further questions about NAS on NCD products.
