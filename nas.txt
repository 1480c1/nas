DISTRIBUTION

	You should have recieved the following file:
	(where x.y is the current revision)

	nas-x.y.src.tar.gz	- gziped tar archive of the source
                                  distribution.

		Unzip/untar this in a nice, quiet, peaceful place.  I
                use 'gzcat nas-x.y.src.tar.gz |tar -xvf -'.

	See the files BUILDNOTES and README for build instructions and
other useful information on NAS.  

	Currently, it's been built on:

        Linux/glibc 2.1, 2.2.14 kernel (Mandrake 7)
        Unixware (X11R5 and native compiler)
        Unixware (X11R6.4 and gcc 2.95.2 compiler)
        HPUX 10.10 using X11R6.1 and gcc 2.95.2
        Sparc Solaris 2.6 using native compiler and X environment
         (Thanks to Martin Buchholz for providing me access to his machine)
	MS Windows systems using cygwin (www.cygwin.com).

	An X11 build environment (xmkmf, imake, X11/ headers, etc) is
required to compile NAS. 


LOCATION
	
	NAS can be obtained (eventually) via ftp from
sunsite.unc.edu, and perhaps ftp.x.org.  More up-to-date information,
as well as the latest release (including development releases) can be
found at http://radscan.com/nas.html 


SYNOPSIS

	Here's an extract from the README file:

	This directory tree contains sources for the Network Audio
System, a network-transparent, client/server audio system, including:

    o   sample server implementations

        - VOXware (FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux, SVR4.[02], MS Windows w/ cygwin)

        - Sun Sparc 1 AM79C30A Digital Subscriber Controller and
              Sparc 10 Dual Basic Rate ISDN Interface
          (SunOS 4.1.[23], Solaris 2.x)

        - SGI Indigo (IRIX 5.x) (Not tested since 1.2p5!)

        - HPUX 10.10+ (may work on 9.x)

    o   an application programming interface library
    o   a variety of sample applications


	Key features of the Network Audio System include:

    o   Device-independent audio over the network
    o   Lots of audio file and data formats
    o   Can store sounds in server for rapid replay
    o   Extensive mixing, separating, and manipulation of audio data
    o   Simultaneous use of audio devices by multiple applications
    o   Use by a growing number of ISVs
    o   Small size
    o   Free!  No obnoxious licensing terms

	...

	See the README file for more information.

	See BUILDNOTES for instructions on building and installing NAS.
