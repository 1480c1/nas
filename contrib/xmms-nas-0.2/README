 xmms-nas - Network Audio System input plugin for X MultiMedia System (xmms)

The Network Audio System is used on most NCD X-terminals and is sometimes part
of the standard X distribution, primarily for getting the sound to the right
place.

Be aware that you're sending upto 180 kb/sec over the network between your
X-terminal and the machine you're running xmms on.  Don't blame me if some
sysadmin kicks your butt for hogging the network.

The time indicator isn't very reliable; it might be off by as much as half
a second, depending on your machine.  This is very hard to get right, because
I don't know when the data actually reaches the other side of the network.

The low water mark doesn't seem to work 100%, so be sure to have a large
enough playing buffer (5000 milliseconds or so should do)

The Network Audio System doesn't support separate left and right volume,
so the balance slider will not work.
