 xmms-nas - Network Audio System input plugin for X MultiMedia System (xmms)
<***************************************************************************>

 Installing xmms-nas
<*******************>

Simply run the following commands:

./configure
make
make install

(If the configure script is not present, run
 aclocal && automake && autoconf)

 Notes
<*****>

The configure script tries to guess the correct location
to install to by looking for the xmms binary.  If you get
a warning because it guesses wrong, you'll have to set the
correct path by giving ./configure the --libdir=<path> option.
