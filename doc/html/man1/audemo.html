Once you have selected the filename, file and data formats,
frequency, mic level, comment and gain, you are
ready to record. To listen in on the audio that will be
recorded you can click on the <I>Monitor</I> button. This will
direct all the audio received from the audio input jack to
be played on the speaker. When you're ready to record,
click on the <I>Record</I> button. All the audio received from
the audio input jack will now be recorded into the file.
The recording will continue until you click on the <I>Record</I>
button again or click on the <I>Dismiss</I> button. <B>NOTE:</B> Audio
data can accumulate very rapidly, especially at high sampling
rates, resulting in large files.

<H2><A NAME="sect7" HREF="#toc7"><B>Buckets</B></A></H2>

<P>
The Network Audio System service provides the capability
to create server resident sound objects called <I>buckets</I>.
<I>audemo</I> allows the user to create <I>buckets</I>, record into
them, play from them, load them with data from a file and
dump their contents into a file. Note that buckets
created by <I>audemo</I> are destroyed when <I>audemo</I> is terminated.
These options are available when you bring up the buckets
window by clicking on the <I>Buckets</I> button in the main window.
The buckets windows is divided into two areas:

<DL>

<DT><B>o</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>A collection of command buttons.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
<B>o</B> A table of buckets currently accessible. This table
contains the following columns:
<P>
<B>Description</B><BR>

The text description.
<P>
<B>Duration</B><BR>

The duration of the audio data in seconds.
<P>
<B>Tracks</B><BR>

A combination of code letters indicating the
access mode of the bucket. A key to the access
code letters can be displayed by clicking on the
<I>Access</I> <I>Key</I> button.

<H2><A NAME="sect8" HREF="#toc8"><B>Creating</B> <B>a</B> <B>Bucket</B> <B>from</B> <B>a</B> <B>File</B></A></H2>

<P>
To create a bucket from from an audio data file, select
the filename from the list of files in the file window
then click the <I>Load</I> button in the buckets window. The
first line of the buckets table should now contain the
information about the newly created bucket.

<H2><A NAME="sect9" HREF="#toc9"><B>Playing</B> <B>from</B> <B>a</B> <B>Bucket</B></A></H2>

<P>
To play a bucket, select the bucket you wish to play by
clicking on it's information in the buckets table. The
entry you click on should be highlighted. Then click on
the <I>Play</I> button in the buckets window. A shortcut for
playing from a bucket is to double-click on the bucket
information. This will select the bucket and start playing
from it. To stop the playing of a bucket, click on
the highlighted <I>Play</I> button in the buckets window. The
level meters and volume level can be controlled in the
same way as when playing from a file.

<H2><A NAME="sect10" HREF="#toc10"><B>Recording</B> <B>to</B> <B>a</B> <B>Bucket</B></A></H2>

<P>
To record into a new bucket, click on the <I>Record</I> button in
the buckets window. This will bring up the record window.
This record window is the same as the one used for recording
to files. Instead of specifying a filename, in the
<I>Max</I> <I>Duration</I> field, enter the maximum duration (in seconds)
of data that the bucket is to hold. Clicking on the
<I>Read</I> <I>Only</I> button will prevent other applications from
writing into or destroying the bucket. The frequency, mic
level, format and comment are used in the same way as when
recording to files. Once all of the fields are set appropriately,
click the <I>New</I> <I>Buckett</I> button. This will create
a new bucket according to the specifications given. The
first line of the buckets table should now contain the
information about the newly created bucket. To begin
recording into the bucket, select the bucket by clicking
on it's information in the buckets table. Then click the
<I>Record</I> button in the record window. All the audio
received from the audio input jack will now be recorded
into the bucket. The recording will continue until you
click on the <I>Record</I> button again, click on the <I>Dismiss</I> or
the bucket is filled. The <I>Gain</I> slider and the <I>Monitor</I>
button operate the same as when recording to a file.

<H2><A NAME="sect11" HREF="#toc11"><B>Saving</B> <B>a</B> <B>Bucket</B> <B>to</B> <B>a</B> <B>File</B></A></H2>

<P>
To save a bucket to a file, first select the bucket by
clicking on its information in the buckets table. Then
click on the <I>Save</I> button in the buckets window. A dialog
box will pop up prompting you for the name of the file in
which to save the bucket data, and the file format. The
data format used will be that of the bucket. Note that
each file format may only support selected data formats.
If no path is given in the filename, the file will be created
in the current directory. Clicking on <I>Ok</I> or pressing
the <B>RETURN</B> key will cause the file to be created and the
data from the bucket to be written to the file.

<H2><A NAME="sect12" HREF="#toc12"><B>Deleting</B> <B>a</B> <B>Bucket</B></A></H2>

<P>
To delete a bucket, first select the bucket by clicking on
it's information in the buckets table. Then click on the
<I>Delete</I> button in the buckets window. If the <I>audemo</I> has
the appropriate access permissions for the bucket, the
bucket will be deleted and it's information will be
removed from the bucket table.

<H2><A NAME="sect13" HREF="#toc13"><B>Exiting</B> <B>Audemo</B></A></H2>

<P>
Clicking on the <I>Quit</I> button will cause <I>audemo</I> to exit,
stopping any playing or recording operations and destroying
any buckets that were created.

<H2><A NAME="sect14" HREF="#toc14"><B>Command</B> <B>Line</B> <B>Options</B></A></H2>

<P>
<B>-audio</B> <I>servername</I><BR>

This option specifies the Network Audio System
server to which <I>audemo</I> should connect.
<P>
<I>directory</I><BR>

The directory name that <I>audemo</I> will use to build
the list of selectable file names. When <I>directory</I>
is not specified on the command line, the current
working directory is used.

<H2><A NAME="sect15" HREF="#toc15"><B>Examples</B></A></H2>

<P>
In the following example, in a <I>TCP/IP</I> network, <I>mcxterm</I> is
the name of the desktop machine running the audio server.
The default port is <I>8000</I> and sound files are located in
<I>~/snd</I>:
<P>
audemo -audio tcp/mcxterm:8000 ~/snd
<P>
In the following example, the shortened form of the audio
server name is used and sound files from the current working
directory will be used:
<P>
audemo -audio mcxterm:0

<H2><A NAME="sect16" HREF="#toc16"><B>Environment</B></A></H2>

<P>
In addition to the standard toolkit environment variables,
the following environment variables are used by <I>audemo</I>:

<DL>

<DT><B>AUDIOSERVER</B></DT></DT>
<DD>
This variable specifies the default audio server
to contact if <I>-audio</I> is not specified on the command
line. If this variable is not set and the
<I>-audio</I> is not specified on the command line,
<I>audemo</I> will attempt to connect to the audio server
running on the X Window System display.
</DD>
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="sect17" HREF="#toc17"><B>Bugs</B></A></H2>

<P>
Warning: audemo is the xterm of the Network Audio System.
It was written to test features as the Network Audio System
was being developed. It was also the author's first
Xt program. Consequently, it's pretty ugly and should be
completely re-written from scratch.
