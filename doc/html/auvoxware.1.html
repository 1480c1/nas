<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
auvoxware - Network Audio System server for PCs with the VOXware audio
interface 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>auvoxware</b> [:listen port offset] [-option ...] 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<i>auvoxware</i>
is the NAS server used on PC Unix platforms that support the VOXware device
drivers for popular sound cards. It is able to discover what each device
has in the way of ability and configure itself appropriately. The known
list of platforms that support the VOXware interface are Linux, FreeBSD,
SCO, Unixware and the generic SVR4.2 unixes. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Starting the Server</a></h2>
The server
is usually started from /etc/rc or a user's startup script. <p>
When the Network
Audio System server starts up, it takes over /dev/dsp &amp; /dev/dsp1, according
to the instructions in its configuration file, if any. Note that applications
that attempt to access these devices themselves will fail while it is running.
It will look for a configuration file of the name nasd.conf in the config
directory, e.g. /etc/nas/nasd.conf. If it finds one, it will then open it and
parse the contents, setting up the inputs and outputs as required. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Options</a></h2>
All
of the Network Audio System servers accept the following command line options:

<dl>

<dt><b>-aa</b> </dt>
<dd>Allows clients on any host to connect.  By default, access is allowed
only to clients on the local host. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Signals</a></h2>
The Network Audio System server
attaches special meaning to the following signals: 
<dl>

<dt><i>SIGHUP</i> </dt>
<dd>This signal causes
the server to close all existing connections, free all resources, and restore
all defaults. </dd>

<dt><i>SIGTERM</i> </dt>
<dd>This signal causes the server to exit cleanly. </dd>

<dt><i>SIGUSR1</i>
</dt>
<dd>This signal is used quite differently from either of the above.  When the
server starts, it checks to see if it has inherited SIGUSR1 as SIG_IGN
instead of the usual SIG_DFL.  In this case, the server sends a SIGUSR1
to its parent process after it has set up the various connection schemes.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Diagnostics</a></h2>
Too numerous to list them all. If run from <a href='init.8.html'><i>init(8)</i></a>
, errors are
typically logged in the file <i>/usr/adm/audio*msgs</i>, 
<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Files</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt>/tmp/.sockets/audio*
</dt>
<dd>Unix domain socket </dd>

<dt>/usr/adm/audio*msgs </dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt>/dev/audio </dt>
<dd>Audio device </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>Bugs</a></h2>
<p>
If <i>au</i> dies before its clients,
new clients won't be able to connect until all existing connections have
their TCP TIME_WAIT timers expire. <p>
The current access control support is
weak at best. <p>

The auvoxware server contains much code from the sun sample server,
written originally by Greg Renda and Dave Lemke of NCD, who in turn borrowed
much code from the sample X server. The original VOXware server for Linux
was written by Amancio Hasty (hasty@rah.star-gate.com) and was merged with
the SVR4 VOXware server, written by Stephen Hocking (sysseh@devetir.qld.gov.au).
Christian Schlichtherle (s_schli@ira.uka.de) then added some more Linux fixes,
code to allow full duplex operation on those cards that supported it (GUS,
PAS16, AudioTriX) and did some work on the 16 bit code. Stephen Hocking
made sure it ran under FreeBSD. Shawn M. (shawnm@sco.com) fixed it up to run
under SCO Unix and added code to dynamically adjust the buffer sizes. Stephen
Hocking then added code for the server to use a configuration file. <p>
The
sample X server was originally written by Susan Angebranndt, Raymond Drewry,
Philip Karlton, and Todd Newman, from Digital Equipment Corporation, with
support from a large cast.  It has since been extensively rewritten by Keith
Packard and Bob Scheifler, from MIT. <p>
