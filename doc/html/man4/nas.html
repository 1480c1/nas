Network Audio System - a portable, network-transparent
audio system

<H2><A NAME="sect1" HREF="#toc1"><B>Synopsis</B></A></H2>

<P>
The Network Audio System service is a network-transparent
system developed at Network Computing Devices for playing,
recording, and manipulating audio data over a network. It
uses the client/server model to separate application code
from the software drivers needed to control specific audio
input and output devices.

<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2"><B>Description</B></A></H2>

<P>
The Network Audio System service provides applications
with the ability to send and receive audio data such as
voice, sound effects, and music in a network environment.
A audio server inside the desktop terminal or personal
computer controls the various input and output devices in
response to messages sent from client programs running on
other hosts.
<P>
A variety of utility programs are provided that can be
used to play or record audio using shell scripts or command-line
procedures. More ambitious applications can
communicate directly with the audio server using a C-language
programming library.
<P>
The Network Audio System service supports a variety of the
common formats used to store sound data. Audio inputs and
outputs can run at a any of a range of sampling rates.
The audio server automatically converts all data to the
designed format or rate.
<P>
Streams of data from multiple inputs can be mixed together
and directed to any attached output device. Sounds that
are used many times can be stored in the server so that
they do not need to be transmitted over the network each
time they are played. Furthermore, inputs can be hooked
directly to outputs (for example, a CD player can be connected
to a set of speakers) so that data can be played
without requiring any client intervention or network traffic.

<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3"><B>Audio</B> <B>Server</B> <B>Names</B></A></H2>

<P>
Each audio server has a name that is used by applications
in establishing a connection. The format of the name
depends upon the type of network being used. In TCP/IP
environments, audio server names look like:
<P>
tcp/<I>hostname</I>:<I>portnum</I>
<P>
where <I>hostname</I> is the name or numeric IP address of the
desktop machine to be contacted and <I>portnum</I> is the port
number on which the server is listening. If the ``tcp/''
prefix is not given, 8000 is automatically added to <I>port</I><B>_</B>n<I>um</I>
so that the audio server name is compatible with the X
Window System display name.
<P>
In DECnet environments, audio server names look like:
<P>
decnet/<I>nodename</I>::<I>num</I>
<P>
where <I>nodename</I> is the name or numeric DECnet address of
the desktop machine to be contacted and <I>num</I> is the DECnet
task AUDIO$<I>num</I>. If the ``decnet/'' prefix is omitted, it
is automatically added so that the audio server name is
compatible with the X Window System display name.
<P>
Most audio utilities accept a command line argument <I>-audio</I>
<I>servername</I> for specifying the audio server to be contacted.
<P>
% auinfo -audio tcp/ncdunit:8000
<P>
If no server is specified on the command line, the
AUDIOSERVER environment variable is checked to see if a
name has been stored there. Otherwise, the DISPLAY environment
variable used by X Window System applications is
checked and the corresponding audio server is used.

<H2><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#toc4"><B>Sample</B> <B>Programs</B></A></H2>

<P>
Several sample programs that use the Network Audio System
service are provided by NCD:
<P>
<B>auplay</B> This program simply plays the files listed on its
command line. It is typically used from shell
scripts, command-line procedures, or other programs
that just need to ``dump'' sound data to the
audio server.
<P>
<B>audemo</B> This program allows the user to select and play
pre-recorded sound files or to record new sound
files. It provides a simple control panel for
dynamically changing the volume while a sound is
being played and for aborting a sound.
<P>
<B>audial</B> This program generates North American telephone
touch tones correspond to a given string. <I>audial</I>
can also recognize touch tones and produce the
corresponding string.
<P>
<B>autool</B> This program is compatible with the Sun <I>audiotool</I>
program and is typically used to play prerecorded
sound files. Unlike <I>auplay</I> it provides a graphical
interface to allow the user to replay or cancel
the data.
<P>
<B>auinfo</B> This program lists information describing the
<P>
capabilities of an audio server.
<P>
<B>auctl</B> This program can be used to change various device
parameters.
<P>
<B>auscope</B> This program is an audio protocol filter that can
be used to view the network packets being sent
between an application and an audio server.
<P>
<B>aupanel</B> This program provides an X-based window-oriented
interface allowing the user to adjust the
attributes of the devices provided by the Network
Audio System service.
<P>
<B>auedit</B> This program provides an X-based window-oriented
interface allowing the user to edit audio files.
<P>
<B>auconvert</B><BR>

This program allows the user to perform various
conversion operations on sound files.
<P>
<B>auphone</B> This program provides an X-based window-oriented
interface allowing two-way real time voice communication
between two audio servers.
<P>
<B>aurecord</B><BR>

This program is used to record audio data from an
audio server into a file.
<P>
<B>auwave</B> This program provides an X-based window-oriented
interface demonstrating the use of waveform elements.

<H2><A NAME="sect5" HREF="#toc5"><B>Audio</B> <B>Files</B></A></H2>

<P>
The audio programming library and utility programs can be
used to read and write files in any of the following file
formats:
<P>
<B>Sun/NeXT</B><BR>

These files typically have a `.au' or `.snd' extension.
They are usually produced by Sun or NeXT
workstations.
<P>
<B>Creative</B> <B>Labs</B><BR>

These files typically have a `.voc' extension.
They are usually produced by by Soundblaster audio
cards on IBM PC compatible computers.
<P>
<B>Microsoft</B> <B>WAVE</B><BR>

These files typically have a `.wav' extension.
They are usually produced by IBM PC compatible computers.

<DL>

<DT><B>AIFF</B></DT></DT>
<DD>
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
These files typically have an `.aiff' or `.aif'
extension. They are usually produced by SGI workstations
or Apple computers.
<P>
<B>Amiga</B> <B>IFF/8SVX</B><BR>

These files typically have an `.iff' extension.
<P>
Due to the nature of the file formats, only the Sun/NeXT
file format can be piped through standard input and/or
standard output. The convention for specifying standard
input or standard output is to use a hyphen ("-") as the
file name.

<H2><A NAME="sect6" HREF="#toc6"><B>Programming</B></A></H2>

<P>
Application developers may create their own audio clients
using the Network Audio System programming library.

<H2><A NAME="sect7" HREF="#toc7"><B>Environment</B> <B>Variables</B></A></H2>

<P>
The following environment variables are used by Network
Audio System programs:

<DL>

<DT><B>AUDIOSERVER</B></DT></DT>
<DD>
This specifies the name of default audio server to
contact if no name is explicitly given on the command
line.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
<B>DISPLAY</B> This specifies the name of an X Window System display
that should be assumed to also have a corresponding
Network Audio System server.
